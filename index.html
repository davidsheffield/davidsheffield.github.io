            <p>I am a particle physicist moving to data science. As a member of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_Muon_Solenoid">Compact Muon Solenoid</a> (CMS) experiment at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_Hadron_Collider">Large Hadron Collider</a> (LHC) I searched for evidence of new particles that interact with the strong force producing &ldquo;jets&rdquo;.</p>
            <p>My dissertation was on the search for particles that decayed to two jets (dijets). My fellow analyzers and I did not find evidence for new particles and excluded particles at a variety of masses and parameters. I was one of the people that implemented data scouting for the experiment, which allows for searches of particles at lower masses by saving portions of events that otherwise would have been lost.</p>
